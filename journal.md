**Total Time Spent So Far: 40 Hours**

## **Log 1: CoreXY vs Cartesian Wars**
googled “corexy vs cartesian” and watched videos for hours.  
decided corexy looks cleaner and cooler so i'm doing that.  
folder created: `CoreXY_Build`, and it now contains 40 screenshots and 2 memes.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**

## **Log 2: Idlers Are a Scam**
found out that idlers need to be aligned perfectly or the belts become noodles.  
sketched something random in Fusion and tried placing 1 X Left_Idler_Mount.stl.  
everything looked okay until i realized nothing was actually constrained.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**

## **Log 3: Motor Mount Geometry is Black Magic**
placed the A and B motor mounts and tried making them symmetrical.  
fusion 360 said “nah.” had to redo half the sketch.  
ended up with 2 different-looking mounts and prayed they’d work.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**

---

## **Log 4: Feet First**
modeled the bottom feet and tested clearances.  
realized my bed might scrape the PSU mount lol.  
redesigned the feet like 4 times.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**  


---

## **Log 5: Y-Carriage Confusion**
started mocking up the y-carriage setup.  
couldn’t tell which way was front anymore.  
added dummy blocks for top and bottom.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**

---

## **Log 6: The Guide Tube Mount**
decided to add the filament guide path now instead of later.  
made a custom part that looked weirdly like a flute.  
**Time Spent: 1.5 Hours**  


---

## **Log 7: The Endstop Slide Crisis**
wanted to add endstops, forgot to plan their placement.  
made a part called “endstop_slide” and it just floats there.  
works in theory. not tested in the physical realm yet.  
**Time Spent: 1.5 Hours**

---

## **Log 8: Z Motor Woes**
figured out the z-motor position after too long.  
used Right MK1 and Rear+Left combined motor mounts.  
alignment was a pain but at least it looks clean now.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**

---

## **Log 9: Power Inlet Engineering**
added a slot for the power inlet, measured nothing, eyeballed everything.  
made it fit using the "move body" tool 14 times.  
**Time Spent: 1 Hour**

---

## **Log 10: Rear PSU Hopes**
decided to go with a rear PSU mount setup.  
modeled the rear PSU mount and started checking airflow paths.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**

---

## **Log 11: Belt Path Madness**
tried visualizing the belt loop path.  
rotated gantry components 500 times.  
added mock pulleys and tensioners (they float too).  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**

---

## **Log 12: X and Y Carriage Mesh**
finally put together both x and y sides of the gantry.  
printed test versions of left/right carriage tops.  
**Time Spent: 2.5 Hours**

---

## **Log 13: Side PSU Mount Exists**
added the side PSU mount. fits awkwardly but i’ll allow it.  
debated moving it again but left it in for now.  
**Time Spent: 1 Hour**

---

## **Log 14: Z Ledges Exist Now**
designed supports to hold the bed plate—ledges for linear rails.  
used 3 identical supports for symmetry.  
**Time Spent: 1.5 Hours**  


---

## **Log 15: Bed Mount Bracket Bravery**
modeled the bed brackets. printed left, right, and rear.  
tweaked holes after first test didn’t align.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**  

---

## **Log 16: Internal Cable Path Setup**
ran pretend wires through fusion’s comment boxes.  
figured out tube routing from extruder to hotend.  
**Time Spent: 1 Hour**  


---

## **Log 17: Rear Mount Debugging**
rear left motor mount was slightly off—fixed by mirroring.  
also redesigned the rear top plate to match spacing.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**  


---

## **Log 18: Final Folder Chaos**
organized all STL files into named folders.  
renamed half the files to actually make sense.  
made render screenshots and a gif for the gram.  
**Time Spent: 2 Hours**  


---

## **Log 19: Final STL Exports**
cleaned up fusion timeline.  
final export of all 30+ STL files for slicing.  
**Time Spent: 1.5 Hours**  


---

## **Log 20: Writing This Log**
decided i didn’t want to forget how scuffed this journey was.  
writing markdown logs while fusion lags in the background.  
**Time Spent: 1 Hour**

**status update: it might work. or explode. but it looks real.**  
printer is coming to life slowly, piece by piece.  
it’s not done yet, but it’s got *soul*.
