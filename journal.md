# Core3D Build Journal

**total hours spent**  
40 hrs 

## June 13  
day 1  
kinda just vibed and opened fusion 360  
no clue where to start  
watched a few corexy vids and tried understanding how the motion system works  
also saw what frame sizes people usually go for  
**time spent:** 2 hrs

## June 14  
day 2  
started placing 2020 extrusion blocks in fusion  
just a basic cube with a bottom base  
also spent a dumb amount of time scrolling AliExpress looking at linear rails  
almost ordered the wrong size  
**time spent:** 3 hrs

## June 15  
day 3  
realized i need like 3 different sizes of linear rails  
added some mock steppers and tried to figure out where to mount them  
lowkey forgot that z-axis has to move the bed not the head  
**time spent:** 3.5 hrs

## June 16  
day 4  
finally locked in a decent layout  
x and y motors are now in the top corners  
z motors are at the base and i added placeholder lead screws  
learned about mgn12 vs mgn9 and got even more confused  
**time spent:** 3 hrs

## June 17  
day 5  
figured out i need to budget like crazy  
the bom was looking like a mini pc build  
removed some fancy stuff and looked for clone hotends and cheaper psus  
**time spent:** 2.5 hrs

## June 18  
day 6  
printed a few test brackets on my ender  
just to see if the tolerances i’m designing for actually work  
somehow messed up the belt path in cad and had to redo a chunk  
**time spent:** 3 hrs

## June 19  
day 7  
spent 3 hrs just fixing the y gantry  
added gt2 pulleys and realized the spacing is off by like 1mm  
rage quit but came back and fixed it at night  
**time spent:** 4 hrs

## June 20  
day 8  
measured actual extrusion lengths i’d need  
changed the build volume to 220x220x250 to stay sane and within budget  
added BLTouch mount but not sure if i’ll actually use it  
**time spent:** 2 hrs

## June 21  
day 9  
got sidetracked looking at orbiter extruder setups  
designed a mount for it but it’s dummy bulky  
may just switch to bowden if weight becomes a problem  
**time spent:** 3 hrs

## June 22  
day 10  
organized the bom a bit  
cut down costs by around 200 usd  
realized i never added corner brackets to the model  
**time spent:** 2.5 hrs

## June 23  
day 11  
added all the frame reinforcements  
z idlers are now angled and bed is supported from 3 points  
tried simulating belt tension but fusion said nah  
**time spent:** 3.5 hrs

## June 24  
day 12  
finalized most parts in the bom  
still missing bed heater and a few screws but it’s close  
lowkey proud ngl  
**time spent:** 3 hrs

## June 25  
day 13  
wrote this journal  
cleaned up the cad a bit and exported the frame drawings  
gonna take a break before wiring and firmware stuff  
**time spent:** 2 hrs
